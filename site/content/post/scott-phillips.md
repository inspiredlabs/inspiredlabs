assignment: Fearless creative for those who innovate
---
Meeting business requirements for National Geographic, [Siemens](https://vimeo.com/124142652), [Bowers & Wilkins](https://vimeo.com/124144694), and ambitious startups.



My work applies thorough, user-friendly design that moves projects forward. These can be greenfield projects like attention engineering for Aris Technologies. Or a communication strategy for Vaultarch, an award‑winning deep‑tech company.



Currently, my focus is shaping the mobile web. This includes building webapps, graphic design and rapid prototyping. I'm enthusiastic about combining performant code, aesthetics and accessibility.



Turning a brief into assets, I'm comfortable in organisations of different sizes. I have produced resilient templates for startups with a few million in funding. And consulting services to a company with a market capitalisation of over £30b.

But, don't worry if you're not there yet – I also contribute to smaller projects that need help getting off the ground!

Maybe this experience isn't what you are looking for, and that's ok. I work best with talented individuals who innovate. I'm proud to be a fearless creative who can also take on board practical constraints.
