## A huge achievement, against all odds

The Children’s Centre for Civilisation & Creativity, Heliopolis, Egypt endured the usual construction challenges. In 2011, the timing of the Arab-spring and Egyptian revolution further complicated things for Mallinson's Architects & Engineers' team.

Mallinson's winning the Museum + Heritage award in 2012 because of well organised design. Together, collaborators solved problems outside Egypt so the holistic design became a reality.

### Beyond content creation

#### Project background

Appointed to create mixed digital media, including games, touch interfaces and an animated centre-piece consisting of a double-sided, 30m LED wall.

#### Inspiring the next generation

Throughout the project, I had the privilege of mentoring Junior artists. We produced multi-format visuals on deadline for the opening ceremony.
