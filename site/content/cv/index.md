Thank you for your consideration, I hope this information finds you well.

My content development work focuses on performant code. Rarely relying on complex dependencies or configurations, I aim to work at the correct abstraction layer, keeping things&nbsp;accessible.

*   Deploy to [GitHub](https://github.com/inspiredlabs/), served from [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/teams/inspiredlabs/sites/).
*   Using Service Workers for offline capabilities.
*   Custom, modular layouts based on [Tachyons.io](https://tachyons.io/). <!--using [TLDR](https://tachyons-tldr.now.sh/)-->
*   Vanilla Javascript for interaction, [accessibility](https://codepen.io/inspiredlabs/pen/BgYooY), and performance enhancements<!-- –&nbsp;such as offline functionality-->.

### Analytics

*   Custom tracking analytics in Google UA.
*   [Self-hosted](https://matomo.org/gdpr/https://analytics.inspiredlabs.co.uk/) Matomo –&nbsp;for [GDPR compliance](https://matomo.org/gdpr/).

### Performance

*   A simple, yet effective optimisation pipeline to improve the weight of downloadable assets. <!-- Including [UnCSS](https://uncss-online.com/).-->
*   Development quality assurance using [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), and Google PageSpeed&nbsp;insights. <!-- and webpagetest: https://www.webpagetest.org/-->

Clients are mainly technical service agencies that require working prototypes, or turn-key website design and content delivery. Examples not limited to:

*   [Vaultarch](https://vaultarch.com/information). A multi award winning Legal-tech startup protecting valuables.
*   Travel Tours & Guided Trips for [National Geographic](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/j/) Expeditions.
*   Locality. A data entry and sanitisation platform that outputs a JSON API for an estate agent.
*   [3Si](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com). A software house selling web and desktop client CRM products.

I’m familiar with core web technologies (NPM, jQuery and Wordpress – although I avoid them, and prefer the [JAMstack](https://headlesscms.org/)), and have experience with all sorts of popular libraries and tooling.

My background is actually in visual communication. Although I’d built websites prior to 2008, I aimed to be part of the mobile web as that took off. I’m happy to show you [bits-and-bobs](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/design-generalist.html) that include graphic design, typefaces, 3D graphics, animation, design systems and templates leading to the present, as a developer.

*   , and  Ubuntu, Mint and Debian builds

Again, thanks for thinking of me, I welcome inquires and aim to be as flexible as possible.
