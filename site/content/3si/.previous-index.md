## 3Si: 20 years of CRM development

### Who are 3Si, and what they do?

Derived from their surname Chris Sinclair, Pete Sinclair, and their Father – a silent partner, [3Si](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/) sell their CRM application to handle volumes of membership and subscription data. Their flagship product is called [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#modules).

### Client work
The [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#clients) platform is for Nonprofit Organisations such as **Mensa**, **The National Farmer's Union** and **Trading Standards**. I was also concerned with the web platform for **The Pathological Society**.

### Project Legacy

A high performance static site was written for a fresh perspective on their design, whilst honouring branding already in use.

> Scott fully understands the concepts of design… how things flow and the way the message is conveyed to the user. – [Chris&nbsp;Sinclair](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/) Managing Director, 3Si

### Communicating values
Developing a CRM platform can be complicated. **3Si** needs technical design improvements, yet look inkeeping with 20 years of heritage.


By rewriting their [Brochure](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) for an audience of non-technical people, we explain the benefits, without jargon. The company didn't have a definitive glossary, so this project  improved communication for all&nbsp;involved.

After intensive research, marketing material was produced with laser-focus over 7 weeks.

### Content without boundaries
The new document  emphasises clarity. The visual language of [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html#modules) was designed to be cohesive across print and screen, whilst being optimised for mobile. This was all done with a nod to what was already in circulation.

### Content flow

A simple landing page was produced so the document could be proofread in one&nbsp;go. This was written to hold and maintain attention, answer common questions and chime the right note – without&nbsp;duplication.

### Clarity

With a colour‑blind theme, clear navigation and an emphasis on readability people can find the information they need. The goal is to helping them make the right purchase&nbsp;decision.

### Template design
Each template was designed to reduce production time <!-- error rate, --> and unnecessary decision&nbsp;making. Both the [prototype](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html) landing page and the [print](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) material contain the same refreshing&nbsp;content.

*   goal: simplification (linguistic hygiene: clean up terms phrases and conventions, end jargon), scalability, less paper, overcome poor visual acuity, consolidate other marketing material. Be sensitive to what has gone before. Target at decision makers, NOT the end user... is this as integral as they are aiming to be?
