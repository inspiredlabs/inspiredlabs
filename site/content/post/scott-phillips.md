I'm Scott Phillips, Design Generalist from the United Kingdom. For the past few years, I have mainly designed for the mobile web. The rest of the time, I've worked on content for companies like [Siemens](https://vimeo.com/124142652) and [Bowers & Wilkins](https://vimeo.com/124144694).

In my work, I apply thorough, user-friendly solutions to move my client's businesses forward. These can be greenfield projects that require attention engineering, such as [Aris Technologies](https://aristechnologies.com/). Or deeptech projects, such as the award winning [Vaultarch](https://vaultarch.com/).

My services include coding for the web and defining key user experience touch points. These include offline assets, graphics and prototype design. Product design and delivery within a well-resourced team is also of interest.

Previous experience includes template architecture for a gaming platform with millions in funding, and providing communication advice to a company with a market capitalisation of over £30bn.

Don't worry if you're not there yet – I'm happy to work with startups that need help getting off the ground!

Maybe this experience isn't what your organisation is looking for – and that's ok.

Generally, I'm a good fit for agencies that need technical skills, aiming to get ahead of the market. If this is of interest, I'd like to hear from you.
