### Who are 3Si, and what they do?

Derived from their surname Chris Sinclair, Pete Sinclair, and their Father – a silent partner, [3Si](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/) sell their CRM application to handle volumes of membership and subscription data. Their flagship product is called [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#modules). 

### Client work
The [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#clients) platform is for Nonprofit Organisations such as Mensa, The National Farmer's Union and Trading Standards. I was also concerned with the web platform for The Pathological Society.

### Legacy of the project

Produced a high performance static site and a fresh perspective on their designs, whilst honouring what is already in use.

### Communicating values
Developing a CRM platform can be complicated. 3Si needed someone technical to make design improvements, yet inkeeping with 20 years of heritage. 


By rewriting their [Brochure](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) for an audience of non-technical people, I concentrated on benefits, without jargon. This improved communication throughout the company because beforehand the product did not use a glossary.

After intensive research, the marketing material was produced with laser-focus over 7 weeks. 

### Content without boundaries
The new material has an emphasis on clarity. The visual language of [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html#modules) was designed to be cohesive across print and desktop, yet optimised for mobile in harmony with what is already in circulation.

A simple landing page was tested to maintain attention. 

With a colour‑blind theme, clear navigation and an emphasis on readability: people can find the information they need. Helping make the right purchase decision.

### Template design
Each template was designed to reduce production time and unnecessary decision making. Both the [prototype](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html) landing page and the [print](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) material contain the same original content.

*   goal: simplification (linguistic hygiene: clean up terms phrases and conventions, end jargon), scalability, less paper, overcome poor visual acuity, consolidate other marketing material. Be sensitive to what has gone before. Target at decision makers, NOT the end user... is this as integral as they are aiming to be?
