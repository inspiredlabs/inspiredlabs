### Co-habitation Property Services

This webapp helps people in the luxury rental market organise and filter rooms to taste.

### Data sanitisation

Keeping pages fresh means that subtle errors creep into customer-facing pages, often without&nbsp;notice. The&nbsp;UX requirement to check and catch these data-entry mistakes was first-and-foremost&nbsp;priority.

NetlifyCMS,&nbsp;in the browser is utilised for data-entry which produces a terse data&nbsp;template. This is stored as&nbsp;JSON and renders client-side, keeping the information up-to-date without having a complicated&nbsp;processes.

This investment makes maintaining housing properties as simple as possible – even when tiny nuances in content are&nbsp;required.

### Data Minimalism

The same JSON is filtered on the client's browser. There is no need to serve multiple, unchanging files, use a complicated test procedure or even rebuild pages after data&nbsp;entry.
