### Carfax Cafe, Oxford

In 2012 entrepreneur, **Fernando Kindermann** opened _Smiley&nbsp;Cafe_. Friendly hospitality and Brazilian and Italian dishes are served from the shadowy site – although, that formula wasn't enough. The venue struggled to attract passing trade and consistent regulars. To help the Carfax Tower  stand-out, we used design to attract people and boost&nbsp;sales…

### Meet here for Breakfast, Lunch & Tea

The business needed a rebrand. Improvements meant presenting a professional image. We had hard conversations to convince the management to rename the business. Family and friends all have a stake, but Carfax Cafe didn't become **Fernando’s** until weeks into the process – yet Fernando couldn't forgot the hours of investment, and everyone agreed – authenticity works!

The name is sticky. The purpose of the site needs to be simple to grasp <!--for visitors with limited English-->and recognisable.**Carfax&nbsp;Cafe** is centre-point for locals and a meeting point for&nbsp;visitors. Helping people act, we proposed an obvious call-to-action:<!-- was designed into the strap-line --> _Meet here for Breakfast, Lunch & Tea_. This works becasue it reveals the friendly informal nature of the business and implys the business&nbsp;function.

<!-- This is a fast food meetup for passers&nbsp;by. -->

### Thorough design, diligent typography

The remaining 12th-century **St Martin's Church Tower**, known as **Carfax Tower** deserves a visual language in recognition to the site history. In the middle of this epoch, seventeenth-century Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church: **John Fell** (1625 – 1686), began an important historical undertaking in typography development (as documented by [Igino Marini](https://iginomarini.com/fell/history/)).

Today, inspired by his endeavour, revival faces mimic [The Fell Types (by H&FJ)](https://www.typography.com/fonts/historical-allsorts/inside/fell-types/), giving us a glimpse of the idiosyncratic, hand-fabricated glyphs.

The aim of this graphic design goes beyond utility – adding cultural relevance, important both in terms of typography, and historical&nbsp;Oxford.

### Everyone's favourite

The design, at first glance is simple – however, it's a complex interplay of revivalism, paired with a modern classic: [Cooper&nbsp;Black Swash](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7357/cooper-black).

Bringing a hearty, abundant tone to the letterforms, finished on tastefully coloured board makes for a traditional storytelling foundation. Now the site is established, fostering five-star&nbsp;reviews.

### Point of interest

Researching historical facts about the **Carfax Tower** lead to seek the original plans from the [Oxfordshire History Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/acjE8RS4M4U2). This elevates the menu by divulging interest beyond&nbsp;fast-food.
