#### Communicating family values
A warm, welcoming website clear for local people looking for fresh, organic produce. Yet appealing to food connoisseurs, even overseas.

#### Powerful tools for nimble pages

This mobile first eCommerce site runs via NetlifyCMS, a web interface for writers. A static site generator called HUGO produces flat files without a database. This combination scores highly with Google PageSpeedInsights.

#### Manageable styling
Tachyons adapts to design needs. By patching existing classes fixes limitations in the library. Consciously adding utility classes keeps things manageable, while extending default behavior. 

These work with Javascript for accessibility and for image handling blazy.js.

<!--list.js handles client-side search. And the gallery is handled by Flickity.-->

This combination places content in the hands of the author. Resulting in lightweight, rich, multilingual content – without bloat. 

#### Intelligent systems
With OpenCV we aim to solve common problems during harvest. Machine learning and artificial intelligence should resolve challenges of abundance.

#### The problem with quality control
Automating farm activities isn't always viable, and still relies on a hierarchy of farmhands.
Monitoring people's output is often met with resistance. So to improve precision harvesting and simplify the rules, algorithmic comparison provides a cost-effective way to monitor yeilds. By prototyping with OpenCV, the business is exploring the viability of automation and reaping the benefits.
