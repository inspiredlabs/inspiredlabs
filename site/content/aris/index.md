## The project in detail

### Template driven user interface design

As the lead user interface designer, realised the templates for a broad range of games – from roulette, to video slots within Flash and within a 3D environment using OpenGL. These templates were populated with unique content by the art department where the client and web teams supplied the underlying gaming logic.

### Multi-OS, multi-resolution assets

The common UI took shape as a rugged arcade machine with realistic features. It's design is highly modular. Each game title has consistent graphics and templating throughout the whole series – these assets remain in place 10 years later proving, skeuomorphic UI is still relevant in gaming.

### Branding

Co-producing a range of branded game titles and wrote specification documents forming a sound business case for each project.

### Investor related content

Produced presentations on spec. for managerial/ investor relations to steer business decisions.
