## Thomas Manss

### Creating something remarkable

**Bowers & Wilkins** make the worlds most advanced hi-fi products. Partnering with Apple, Jaguar and Lucasfilm, I was brought onboard by [Thomas Manss](http://www.manss.com/en/Project/Vintage-at-Goodwood), to celebrate their “true sound” in-car audio products for the **Vintage at Goodwood**&nbsp;conference.

### Conference opener

The outline of the brief was to tell the evolutionary story of **Bowers & Wilkins**, under strict oversight of the talented art-director: **Thomas Manss**. Ceding creative control to overcome the typical mixed-media project&nbsp;hurdles, we brought the **B&amp;W** story to life.

### Legacy

Turning this&nbsp;memorable, musical ditty really hit the right&nbsp;note – receiving rapturous&nbsp;applause. Marking the begining of profitable&nbsp;relationships.

### 3D Modelling

Modelling and rendering realistic speaker components throughout their range was a pleasure – working with admirable, beautiful source&nbsp;material.
