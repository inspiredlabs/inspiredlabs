#### Communicating family values

A warm, welcoming brand – clear for local people looking for fresh, organic produce. Yet appealing to food connoisseurs, even overseas.

#### Traditional Graphic Design

Devoured by&nbsp;hype: _fresh, organic produce_ is mis-sold. Marzo, on the other-hand tell the real&nbsp;story, embracing a lo-fidelity, informal aesthetic<!--intimidation-free: (but can you spot the intentional&nbsp;mistake?)-->.

#### Powerful, nimble pages

The website is mobile-first, developed on [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), an interface for zero-compromise&nbsp;authours integrating with&nbsp;GitHub. A static site generator called [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) produces flat files without a database. This combination scores highly with Google PageSpeedInsights.

#### Component Library

[Tachyons](tachyons.io/)&nbsp;adapts to design needs. By creating a modular visual library, it is possible to consciously add components, without too-much complexity. This keeps things manageable, while extending default behavior and serves as a spring-board for future&nbsp;projects.

I have patched existing classes to fix limitations in the library. Everything works with from static HTML. Javascript enhances accessibility and improves download handling for heavy, full-screen images.

list.js handles client-side search. And the gallery is handled by Flickity.

This combination places content in the hands of the author. Resulting in lightweight, rich, multilingual content – without bloat.

#### Empirically tested

Marzo.li scores 100% on [Google PageSpeed insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https://marzo.li/). Learn more on the [GTMetrix report](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/gtmetrix.com/reports/may-2019-marzo.li.pdf).




<!--#### Intelligent systems

With OpenCV we aim to solve common problems during harvest. Machine learning and artificial intelligence should resolve challenges of abundance.

#### The problem with quality control
Automating farm activities isn't always viable, and still relies on a hierarchy of farmhands.
Monitoring people's output is often met with resistance. So to improve precision harvesting and simplify the rules, algorithmic comparison provides a cost-effective way to monitor yeilds. By prototyping with OpenCV, the business is exploring the viability of automation and reaping the benefits.
