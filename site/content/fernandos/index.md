### Carfax Cafe, Oxford

In 2012 entrepreneur, **Fernando Kindermann** opened _Smiley&nbsp;Cafe_ in the centre of Oxford offering friendly hospitality and a Brazilian and Italian dishes – although, the formula wasn't enough. The venue struggled to attract passing trade and consistent regulars. To help the shadowy, Carfax Tower business stand-out, we used design to boost&nbsp;sales…

### Meet here for Breakfast, Lunch & Tea

The business needed a rebrand. Branding improvements and a professional image began with conversations convincing the core management to rename the business. Family and friends all have a stake in the business, but Carfax Cafe didn't become **Fernando’s** until weeks into the process – yet Fernando couldn't forgot the hours of investment, and everyone agreed – it really works!

Soon, the name was sticky. The purpose of the site needed to be simple to understand <!--for visitors with limited English-->and recognisable. And, **Carfax&nbsp;Cafe** is a powerful attraction for locals that know the&nbsp;area. Helping people recall the famous location we needed a call-to-action:<!-- was designed into the strap-line --> _Meet here for Breakfast, Lunch & Tea_. This  reveals the opening hours and the friendly informal nature of the business. Even if only at a glance, passing&nbsp;by.

### Thorough design, diligent typography

The remaining 12th-century **St Martin's Church Tower**, known as **Carfax Tower** deserves a visual language in recognition to the site history. In the middle of this epoch, seventeenth-century Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church: **John Fell** (1625 – 1686) (documented by [Igino Marini](https://iginomarini.com/fell/history/)), began an important historical undertaking in typography development. Today, inspired by his endeavour, revival faces mimic [The Fell Types (by H&FJ)](https://www.typography.com/fonts/historical-allsorts/inside/fell-types/), giving us a glimpse of the idiosyncratic, hand-fabricated glyphs. 

The aim of this graphic design goes beyond utility – adding cultural relevance, important both in terms of typography, and historical&nbsp;Oxford.

### Everyone's favourite

The design, at first glance is simple – however, it's a complex interplay of revivalism, paired with a modern classic: [Cooper&nbsp;Black Swash](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7357/cooper-black). 

Bringing a hearty, abundant appearance to the letterforms, finished on tastefully coloured cream board: a foundation for storytelling. Now the site is established and is fostering an appetite.
