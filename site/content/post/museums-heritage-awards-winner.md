## A huge achievement, against all odds

In 2011, the project endured the usual construction challenges. The timing of the Arab-spring and Egyptian revolution made things a further challenge. Mallinson's winning the Museum + Heritage award in 2012 was the result of good organisation. Together, collaborators solved problems outside Egypt so the holistic design became a reality.

### Creating multi-format digital media

#### Project background

Appointed by Mallinson's Architects and Engineers, I created content including animating a 30 metre LED wall.

#### Inspiring the next generation

Throughout the project, I also had the privilege to mentor a team of Junior artists to create multi-format media, prior to the opening ceremony.
