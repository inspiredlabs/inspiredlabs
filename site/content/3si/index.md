## Organising the organisers

### Who are 3Si, and what do they&nbsp;do?

Derived from their surname Chris Sinclair, Pete Sinclair, and their Father – a silent partner, [3Si](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/) handle membership and subscription data. With 20&nbsp;years of integrity their in-house&nbsp;CRM has evolved to become:&nbsp;[OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#modules).

### Clients

The [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/#clients) platform has been developed for Nonprofit Organisations such as **Mensa**, **The National Farmer's Union** and **Trading Standards**. The web platform operates for clientele such as **The Pathological Society**. <!-- All need an elegant, bespoke data management&nbsp;solution. -->

### Project Legacy

As the Customer Champion, I went beyond jargon-busting the flagship product. I encouraged a wave&nbsp;of organisational&nbsp;changes, starting with the elimination of unnecessary&nbsp;complexity to lay the foundation of a customer-first Service&nbsp;Design initiative – one, that&nbsp;everyone could get&nbsp;behind.

This challenge led to an awareness of realigning with user&nbsp;needs, embracing critique by over coming resistence to&nbsp;change.

## Customer Champion

### Facing down issues one-by-one

- Broadly impacting the business, I began by holding discovery sessions with  Senior Heads of Function to determine rationale and&nbsp;accountablity.
- Highlighting UX issues, such as: confusing patterns and inconsistent&nbsp;logic.
- Articulated universal principles such as the psychology&nbsp;of familiarity, lingustic&nbsp;consistency, layout and&nbsp;hierachy. Aiming to axe incoherent "Screens".
- Engaged in deep-research with a primary interest in product development.
- Accumalating organisation-specific terminology.
- Analysis of sales onboarding&nbsp;process: leveraging human behaviour for better&nbsp;outcomes.

### Alignment

- Diligently absorbed the product offering (as an imperative), before making recommendations, or conducting fresh design&nbsp;work.
- Included internal _Product Owners_ as key **Stakeholders**. Originally they wrongly considered themselves outside of this important&nbsp;evaluation.
- Encouraged Junior staff to persevere with the _OM.Net Driving Test_. Our&nbsp;group managed a&nbsp;100% pass&nbsp;rate! Although, previously everyone failed first&nbsp;time.
- Introduced the Development Team to [The Double Diamond Methodology](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/Double%20Diamond%20Model%202019.pdf), to systematise iterative&nbsp;feedback into their&nbsp;work.
- Promoted Service&nbsp;Design concepts, initially applied to lighten overall handling&nbsp;of support-tickets.
- Overcame resistance surrounding UAT (User Acceptance Testing), to make the process geniunely in favour of the end-user and an organisational&nbsp;priority.

## Information Architecture

### Structural organisation & arrangement

- Launched a campaign promoting the benefits of Information Architechture (IA), to anchor conversations around common words and&nbsp;terms.
- Began the process of overcoming product-related&nbsp;confusion.
- Creation of an accessible, company-wide glossary, underpinning with the  simplification of the marketing&nbsp;material.
- Redesigned the style guide to reassure heads of function as to the importance of fundamental principles of graphic design such&nbsp;as hierachy, layout and typography.
- Structural representation was necessary prior to the delivery of UI exploiting user centered design principles.
- Attempted simplification (inspite of a legacy offering), to produce flows that steer people toward as few decisions as&nbsp;possible.
- The goal is not simplification per&nbsp;se, but linguistic hygiene&hellip; and apply conventions that reduce distractions (such as visual noise or jargon).

### Communicating values

Developing&nbsp;a CRM platform doesn't need to be overly&nbsp;complicated. **3Si** required technical design improvements in-keeping with 20 years of&nbsp;heritage.

Rewriting&nbsp;their [Brochure](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) for an audience of non-technical people, I explained the benefits, without jargon. The company has their own lexicon, so this project was the first to incorporate their new&nbsp;glossary.

With near-absolute autonomy over an intensive period, the marketing&nbsp;material was produced with laser-focus in just 7&nbsp;weeks.

### Clarity

With an emphasis on readability, people can find the information they need. The goal of task-based information&nbsp;handling is to help people make the right purchase&nbsp;decision.

### Content flow

A&nbsp;simple UI was produced to document the new terminology in one&nbsp;place. This was written to hold and maintain attention, answer common questions and chime the right note – without&nbsp;duplication. A perfect opportunity to overhaul the&nbsp;homepage.

## Visual Design

### Harmony &amp;&nbsp;rhythm

Eye&nbsp;tracking is fantastically capable for modern authours. Before delving into high-tech solutions, however, I went for the most classic&nbsp;device. To truly place emphasis on readability, we must understand the underlying page – what comes _before_&nbsp;content?

The&nbsp;earliest formal tools for composition and layout were crude. _The Villard de Honnecourt Diagram_ (or _Villard's Canon_), however, still has a modern application in illuminating the blank&nbsp;page.

Villard's&nbsp;Canon can remove ambiguity by establishing a typographical box. This works by horizontally and vertically subdividing the&nbsp;space. Naturally, margins emerge&hellip; two ninths for the inner margin and one for the outer margin, and one ninth for the top margin with two ninths for the bottom&nbsp;margin.

Magically,&nbsp;this reveals the text-area and paper size are of equal proportions. Also know as [Rosarivo’s&nbsp;Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction#Interpretation_of_Rosarivo).

What's&nbsp;magic about that? Whatever the page format, it always brings geometrical rhythm which in-turn, informs the proportions of the&nbsp;typeface.

Harmony &amp;&nbsp;rhythm.

### Eye&nbsp;tracking

Research into the [F-Shaped Pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) helps mitigate comprehension issues. By defining content by **user&nbsp;intent**, we create a _Page Agenda_ overcoming common eye&nbsp;tracking results:

#### Page Agenda from 3Si:

- Make headings pop! The **Myriad Pro** typeface has multiple weights to distinguish hierarchy.
- Remove ambiguity. _What does our reader infere from the page?_ Answered in the first paragraph establishes **information scent**, reassuring the reader about the&nbsp;content.
- Exploit laziness. Headings convey more information when they're read, so using fewer words means they're more likely to be&nbsp;parsed.
- Group content by applying IA to each&nbsp;page.
- Test often and&nbsp;iterate. Audiences make assumptions, going beyond _a second&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;eyes_ is&nbsp;invaluable.

### Content without boundaries

The marketing&nbsp;material has an emphasis on clarity. Although the visual language of [OM.Net](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html#modules) required a nod to what was already in&nbsp;circulation.

The design evolved to be optimised for mobile (low-bandwith), and cohesive across print and screen – all done after the initial IA&nbsp;phase.

### Brand Accessibility

A design which can overcome poor visual acuity should also work for people with no visual&nbsp;issues. This was how I began combining colour and&nbsp;shape to inform atmosphere and create a _Visual Language_.

To be adaptive to people's needs, a colour‑blind theme was developed using concepts born out of consumer psychology, applied at the design&nbsp;stage.

Colour can be useful within the context of information gathering – it acts as a clue telling people if they are nearing their&nbsp;goal. What looks&nbsp;"hot", what should I&nbsp;visit, is this a&nbsp;group?

The icons and layout became harmonious across print and screen intentionally making the&nbsp;UI an extension of the&nbsp;brand.

### Template design

Each template was designed to reduce production time, unnecessary decision&nbsp;making and error&nbsp;rate. Both the [prototype](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/index.html) landing page and the [print](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/3-si.com/print/3si-infosheets-draft.pdf) material contain the same refreshing&nbsp;content.

## Frontend development

### Wireframing

- Aligned organisational&nbsp;priorities with Maintainence&nbsp;Developers.
- Proposed dramatic reductionist design to user-flows aimed at improving familiarity.
- Incorporated user centered design principles, such&nbsp;as: discoverability, distraction-free relevance and task-based information&nbsp;handling into various product&nbsp;offerings.

### Writing CSS & HTML

- Prototyping Webapp, similar to spreadsheet application. Cleverly nesting data within a mobile&nbsp;context.
- Designing a new, clean user interface for the web&nbsp;product.
- Produced a high performance static&nbsp;site – written after the fresh perspective on their marketing&nbsp;material, whilst honouring branding already in use.
