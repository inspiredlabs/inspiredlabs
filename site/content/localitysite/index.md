### Co-habitation Property Services

This webapp helps people in the luxury rental market organise and filter rooms to taste.

### JSON sanitisation in NetlifyCMS

The filter takes JSON data and renders it client-side keeping the information up-to-date without having any other build process.

Terse code output from HUGO templates, catches data entry errors. This investment makes maintaining nuances in the properties as simple as possible.
