### Co-habitation Property Services

This webapp helps people in the luxury rental market organise and filter rooms to taste.

### JSON sanitisation in NetlifyCMS

The filter takes JSON data and renders it client-side keeping the information up-to-date without having complicated processes likely to fail.

Terse output from data templates, will catch data-entry mistakes. This investment makes maintaining the properties as simple as possible – even when tiny nuances in content are&nbsp;required.
