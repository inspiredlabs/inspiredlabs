### JAMstack to improve health

Written in HUGO and deployed to NetlifyCMS for speed and&nbsp;simplicity this site helps people understand the health&nbsp;benefits of cold&nbsp;exposure.

Securing bookings as an Ice&nbsp;Coach and educator Alessandro&nbsp;Ronca vividly explains the benefits of The&nbsp;Wim&nbsp;Hof&nbsp;Method in Italian _and_ English.

### Multiple Challenges Accepted!

Forseen technical challenges included:

- NetlifyCMS doesn't officially support multilingual sites<!--LINK-->.
- high-quality templates for **Schema.org** are largely undocumented<!--LINK-->.

Both solutions were possible by writing complex templates with nested&nbsp;data.

### Search Engine Whisperer

HUGO templates automate JSON+LD capture people's imagination to improve thier health on SERP (Search Engine Results Pages).
