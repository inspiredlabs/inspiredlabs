## An impressive heritage

### About Advanced

[Advanced Animations](http://www.advancedanimations.co.uk/) is a traditional technical drawing office offering services **Rolls&nbsp;Royce** and innovators such as:<!-- ,--> [**Siemens**](https://vimeo.com/124142652), [**Cummins**](http://www.advancedanimations.co.uk/animation/) and other  [household names](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUTHkGhyZ6eOvesWGjAczFQ). 

Although, their&nbsp;heritage hasn't made them immune to technological&nbsp;progress.

### Legacy

Brought on board specifically to modernise business practices, we formed the foundation of a new business model – providing them a robust ROI years into the&nbsp;future.

## About the <!--Business Modernisation--> project<!-- in detail-->

### Updating workflow and business model

Simply put areas of the business were reduced to templates. When in place, they expediate business decisions, accelerate work-flow and increase flexability. By enforcing constraints there can be improvements to&nbsp;profitability.


### All-round technical artist

Focusing on CAD/CAM with skilled artists and modellers we produced 3D animation and environments dealing with complex manufacturing&nbsp;topics. 

Generally CAM assets require texturing and illumination in a studio environment before being pre-visualised as animated scamps. After, they were distributed to custom network render-farm, stiched together and post-processed. Particularly enjoyable, were technical renders for **Master Mover** and **Gattic**, both enormously satisfying.

Other noteworthy projects include typography for [Pulse Fitness](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/pulse-fitness/sol-x-specimen/). 

<!--### Diverse technical challenges

network render-farm, etc.-->

### Experimental Technologies

Early 64bit technology brought stability to very complex data-sets in 3D Studio Max. Solving these implementation issues proved to be an intrinsic part of working with CAM assets. A rewarding relationship with **Autodesk** blossomed using our artwork to advertise their acquisition of **nPower**, Power Booleans, described as [a cut above the rest](http://www.npowersoftware.com/booleans/pbgallery.htm).

You might say we were at the cutting-edge of the engineering&nbsp;industry!
