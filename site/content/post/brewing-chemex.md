I'm Scott Phillips, Design Generalist from the United Kingdom. For the past few years, I have mainly designed for the mobile web. The rest of the time, I've worked on content for companies like Siemens and Bowers & Wilkins.



In my work, I apply thorough, user-friendly solutions to move my client's businesses forward. These can be greenfield projects that require attention engineering, such as Aris Technologies. Or deeptech projects, such as the award winning Vaultarch.



My services include coding for the web and defining key user experience touch points. These include offline assets, graphics and prototype design. Product design and delivery within a well-resourced team is also of interest.



Previous experience includes template architecture for a gaming platform with millions in funding, and providing communication advice to a company with a market capitalisation of over £30bn.



Don't worry if you're not there yet – I'm happy to work with startups that need help getting off the ground!



Maybe this experience isn't what your organisation is looking for – and that's ok.



Generally, I'm a good fit for agencies that need technical skills, aiming to get ahead of the market. If this is of interest, I'd like to hear from you.
