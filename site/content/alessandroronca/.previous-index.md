### Multilingual&nbsp;booking

Written in HUGO and deployed to NetlifyCMS for speed and&nbsp;simplicity this site helps people understand the health&nbsp;benefits of cold&nbsp;exposure.

Securing bookings as an Ice&nbsp;Coach and educator Alessandro&nbsp;Ronca vividly explains the benefits of The&nbsp;Wim&nbsp;Hof&nbsp;Method in Italian _and_ English.

### Challenge Accepted!

Forseen technical challenges included:

- NetlifyCMS does not officially support multilingual sites<!--LINK-->.
- high-quality templates for **Schema.org** poorly documented<!--LINK-->.

Both solutions were possible by writing complex templates with nested&nbsp;data.

### Search Engine Whisperer

Technical SEO templates were written to helps capture people's imagination when looking for ways to improve thier&nbsp;health.

The SERP (Search Engine Results Pages) now proved authors with granular control over how their pages look for the first time they are seen.

JSON+LD was generated to meet modern search engine requirements with techniques inspired by&nbsp;Yoast and tested on Google's [Structured Data Test Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool#url=https%3A%2F%2Falessandroronca.netlify.com).
