## An impressive heritage

### About _Advanced_
Advanced Illustrations was a traditional technical drawing office, servicing **Rolls&nbsp;Royce**, [**Siemens**](https://vimeo.com/124142652), **Cummins** and other [household names](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUTHkGhyZ6eOvesWGjAczFQ).

Although their&nbsp;heritage did not made them immune to&nbsp;progress.

### Legacy

Brought on board specifically to modernise business practices, our work together formed the foundation of a new business model – providing them a robust ROI years into the&nbsp;future. With a new name to reflect their offering: [Advanced&nbsp;Animations](http://www.advancedanimations.co.uk/).

## About the <!--Business Modernisation--> project<!-- in detail-->

### Updating the service&nbsp;model

Areas of the business such as maps, were cumbersome – potentially being erroded by data-driven Goliaths. There was a need for a fast-turnaround, service&nbsp;mindset.

I began by developing animation based on the the most demanding client-requirements. This was rapidly reduced to templates. In place, these expediate business decisions, accelerate work-flow and increase flexability. For other Animators, they enforce constraints, yet still allow for improvements to yeild&nbsp;profitability.

### All-round technical artist

Focusing on CAD/CAM with skilled modellers, I produced animation, lighting environments and camera patterns that were rich in dealing with complex manufacturing&nbsp;topics.

Generally, assets require a studio environment before being pre-visualised as animated scamps. Then, they are distributed to a simple, custom network render-solution. The pipe-line helped managed how we stiched together output and processed post processing with a reductionist methodology.

### Profitable technology adoption

64bit technology was a complex, experimental technology. Our client's goals quickly became very demanding when restricted by a 32bit solution, so I diligently configured the new 3D Studio platform to bring stability to very complex data-sets – automating boilerplate, standardising scenes and componentising assets for&nbsp;re-use.

Solving implementation issues is an intrinsic part of working with complex geometry. However, it was clear that solving these issues early would become the foundation of the future&nbsp;profit-model.

### Extended Network

A rewarding relationship with [Autodesk](https://www.advancedanimations.co.uk/portfolio/joloda-autodesk-sales-promo/) blossomed using our _Power&nbsp;Booleans_ artwork to advertise their acquisition of **nPower**. This work was described as [a cut above the rest](http://www.npowersoftware.com/booleans/pbgallery.htm).

Using _Power&nbsp;Booleans,_ the Siemens&nbsp;Napier project, was literally – at the cutting-edge of the&nbsp;industry!

### Clientele

Particularly noteworthy were technical renders for **Master Mover**, **Gattic** and typography (font design), for [Pulse Fitness](http://inspiredlabs.co.uk/pulse-fitness/sol-x-specimen/). I also help produced web UI for **Robat** and many storyboards and animated scenes for [Joloda](https://vimeo.com/124142651), Cummins and [Siemens](https://vimeo.com/124142652).
