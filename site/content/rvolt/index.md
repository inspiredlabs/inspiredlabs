### Beyond Sustainability

The platform shares 20 years of learning about domestic and community sustainability.

The aim is to connect other design sucesses with people across&nbsp;disciplines.

<!-- Generalists should share expertise across common areas of focus -->

### Areas of focus

Designed with Generalists in mind, the project brings attention to key areas of change: Health, Education, Food, Transport and Shelter.

This isn't focused on countries finding ways to justify the costs of managing the Climate Crisis – but how design should raise life quality for billions.
