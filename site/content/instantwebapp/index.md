## Background

### Reduce investment risk

Intended&nbsp;for entrepreneurs to control their costs and guarantee content delivery to their customer's&nbsp;devices.

### Component Based Design

Meeting business goals, controlling costs and avoiding gotchas does not mean generic, undesirable&nbsp;designs.

In&nbsp;fact, it is easier to delight the user when there are constraints are inplace that help lay the&nbsp;groundwork.

### Process

#### Discovery & Definition

The&nbsp;goal at this stage is to create a credible **wireframes** to reflect the client's&nbsp;demands.

#### Component&nbsp;Libraries

I use component&nbsp;libraries that are based on a custom template design to enhance productivity.

This means, I can obsess over the implementation details for every project. Each generation of development feeds-back into the offering, advancing the&nbsp;standard – pushing what's possible,&nbsp;faster.

#### Testing

Completing tasks on an app deserves good user interface design. The interface is tested to work on customer's devices.

Clear, readable text, decent hit areas and thoughtful calls-to-action need testing and improvement to really meet business goals.

Each design iteration is based on empirical testing with close attention paid to the client-led focus group's&nbsp;suggestions.

Marketing&nbsp;campaigns, aesthetics and task-based goals can all happen from a sound foundation. I beleive this is much better than energy spent on&nbsp;reinvention.

### Performant

The design has undergone many iterations to achieve a [GTMetrix UX score: 100%](https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/gtmetrix.com/reports/pablowoodward.com.pdf).
