## Award winning Ltech startup

Cambridge University's [Andrew Buchanan](https://vaultarch.com), set out to make counterfeit, theft and fraud a thing of the past: **Vaultarch** is a multi award winning Ltech (Legal tech) startup protecting valuable collectables.

> Scott displayed energy & resourcefulness… He has good networking skills & an eye for the <!--most important--> commercial factor <cite>– Andrew Buchanan, [Vaultarch](https://vaultarch.com) </cite>

<!--

### Project Legacy

Validating the project's scalability it is clear there is a need for a robust technical solution to protect valuable collectables. The idea has lead to positive feedback from risk averse investors, such as insurance companies and **Vaultarch** has the potential of an innovative investment.

## Project in detail

### Why is Vaultarch important?

**Magic The Gathering** playing cards can be valuable – some are [£30,000 each](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Black-Lotus-Beta-Edition-1993-Magic-The-Gathering-SGC-Graded-92-/322376065501). This makes them attractive to counterfeit, theft and fraud. Motivated through having early edition cards stolen – **Vaultarch** fill an important niche.

### Deeptech innovation

The approach uses machine vision to process translucent image data captured using a smartphone. Organic patterns inside paper act as a fingerprint, which is impossible to fake – offering provenance and storage in a secure database, amongst other security benefits.

Using OpenCV and pHASH the solution overcomes several problems, unique to this industry, yet not limited to it – as the solution scales it will lucratively impact other areas of the insurance industry.

### Community building

Connecting relevant industry insiders means Vaultarch can earn trust. And by finding their first customers they can develop a product tailored to their target market from the very beginning.

### Find the best VC investors

Opening the network up overseas with [card traders](https://www.facebook.com/maseraticoupe007/), we shared insight into asset grading, verification and provenance and the multi-billion dollar secondary marketplace.

Attended events and working from campus to develop strategies for further seed funding, we [met](https://www.meetup.com/TechCityCoffee/photos/27448921/#456364421) with investors such as [Simon Cook](http://draperesprit.com/partner/simon-cook/), and TV's "secret millionaire" [Mike Greene](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Failure-Breeds-Success-Step-step/dp/0957547617/). This was useful to learn about the trajectory of a high potential businesses like the Vaultarch opportunity.

### Business Development

*   Described the solution (openCV), using a simulation of point-to-point recognition using Photoshop convolution matrix to articulate machine vision goals.
*   Research market validation, competitor analysis, patent and intellectual property considerations and hiring.
*   Risk assessment covering: business risk, market risk and technical risk.

### Content and copywriting

Vaultarch's “Preventing counterfeit, theft & fraud” proved to work when attention is scarse and helps maintain design consistency.

### Summary

Prioritising the main thing “most startups fail” at, Vaultarch have marketed the business from inception. It is accepted that any startup should be evenly balanced, concentrating on [a three-pronged approach](http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/why-most-start-ups-fail.html) to product design: user experience, engineering, and marketing.

Vaultarch started as they mean to go on.
