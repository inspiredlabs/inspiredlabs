### Conference opener

**Bowers & Wilkins** make the worlds most advanced hi-fi products. Partnering with Apple, Jaguar and Lucasfilm, I was brought onboard by [Thomas Manss](http://www.manss.com/en/Project/Vintage-at-Goodwood), to celebrate their “true sound” in-car audio products for the **Vintage at Goodwood**&nbsp;conference.

### Legacy

Turning 2D illustrations into versatile storytelling elements, we created a memorable musical short overcoming many hurdles. This introduced delegates to the annual conference – to rapturous&nbsp;applause.

## Project in detail

### Thomas Manss creates something remarkable

The outline of the brief was to tell the evolutionary story of **Bowers & Wilkins**, under strict oversight of the talented art-director: **Thomas Manss**. Ceding creative control to overcome the inherent complexities of making animation, we brought the **Bowers** story to life.

Modelling and rendering realistic speaker components throughout their range was a pleasure – working with admirable, beautiful source&nbsp;material.
