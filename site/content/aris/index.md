### Software that follows the sun

[Aris&nbsp;Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aris-technologies-ltd.) develop online gaming platforms in niche&nbsp;markets. Established to follow the sun, Aris produces secure code during GMT, testing in China and constantly deployed within the&nbsp;USA.

### Project Legacy

I delivered high performance assets that remain in use: earning millions of impressions, across thousands of games, delivering a solid return on investment for Aris' most demanding private&nbsp;operators.

The sophisticated user&nbsp;interface – copied by competitors, continues to underpin the every product the [Development A-Team](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aris-technologies-ltd.)&nbsp;create.

## The project in detail

### Template driven user interface design

As the lead user interface designer, realised the templates for a broad range of games – from roulette, to video slots within Flash and within a 3D environment using OpenGL. These templates were populated with unique content by the art department where the client and web teams supplied the underlying gaming logic.

### Multi-OS, multi-resolution assets

The common UI took shape as a rugged arcade machine with realistic features. It's design is highly modular. Each game title has consistent graphics and templating throughout the whole series – these assets remain in place 10 years later proving, skeuomorphic UI is still relevant in gaming.

### Branding

Co-producing a range of branded game titles and wrote specification documents forming a sound business case for each project.

### Investor related content

Produced presentations on spec. for managerial/ investor relations to steer business decisions.
