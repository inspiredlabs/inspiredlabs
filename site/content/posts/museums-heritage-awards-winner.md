## A huge achievement, against all odds

The Children’s Centre for Civilisation & Creativity, Heliopolis, Egypt endured the usual construction challenges. In 2011, the timing of the Arab-spring and Egyptian revolution further complicated things for Mallinson's Architects & Engineers' team.

Mallinson's winning the Museum + Heritage award in 2012 because of well organised design. Together, collaborators solved problems outside Egypt so the holistic design became a reality.
